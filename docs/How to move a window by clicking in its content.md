# How to move a window by clicking in its content

If you cannot click on the title bar of a form window because it is below the toolbar or menu bar, or if you cannot resize a window because the resize anchor is off the screen, here is the keyboard shortcut that will get you out of trouble:

## On macOS

> Hold down the **Command** (⌘) and the **Control** (⌃) keys and **click in any part of the window**.

## On Windows

> Hold down the **Control** (⌃) and the **Shift** (⇧) keys, then press and hold the **left mouse button** in any part of the window, then press and hold the **right mouse button**.
